The [zBitX](https://www.hfsignals.com/index.php/zbitx/) is a software defined radio (SDR) project that comes from teh the 'Bit' stable of HF radio. The specs and details can be found on the link so I'm not going to repeat them here. Needless to say I'm writing about it because I bought one.

Why did I buy one when I already have a few little HF rigs?

Well, because this one is different. The rig runs off a Raspberry Pi Zero (Oh and the screen is managed with a Raspberry Pi Pico). So what? Well this means that a cheap, small and basic radio can have all sorts of additional features packed into it. Out of the box is does what you might expect, CW, SSB and AM but also FT8. I'm by no means and FT8 user but making the mode integrated into the radio makes for a totally different proposition.

Its true to say that this is a work in progress. The case is a sot mix of 3D printing and aluminium heat sink. It functions perfectly, but looks a bit like a homebrew rig (which it sort of is, albeit produced by a well known and respected designer). Stuff that I like..

* CW keyer with macros
* Integrated Logbook
* Works with G7UFU [Turret Mic](https://shop.g7ufo.radio/products/g7ufo-turret-mini-microphone-for-elecraft-kx2-kx3-fx-4cr-zbitx)
* SWR meter built in

So far I've had a play with it at home. My plans are to use this /P but haven't had the time to take it out in the wild. I suspect that the integrated 18650 battery compartment and small form factor will make this a handy rig to take onto summits. I'll need a suitable padded bag to protect it. Maybe something I can design and sew at home (I've never done this byw :-))
