I'm going to dump all sorts in here. Watch me..

There are a few things I like outside radio. Like just going out on the fells for an overnight camp, I row in a 2, 2x-, 4- & 4x- at Derwentwater in Keswick with the [Lakeland Rowing Club](https://www.lakelandrowingclub.com/). The picture below is me and my main partner at Tees. I think I splashed him a bit but he ended up losing the blade. We still won the race but the picture ended up on Masters Rowing website

I've done a few [Fred Whitton Rides](https://fredwhittonchallenge.co.uk/), Marathons (London & Edingurgh), Half marathons and local 10k's. I'm not super fast but enjoy it. Especially watching others ride up Hardknott pass. Some of the events have seen me doing marshalling as part of [Raynet](https://www.raynet-uk.net/) but mostly just to help out
