Shortwave Listening (SWL) is really what I like the most. I do enjoy making contacts but have always been a fan of receivers. In fact right now I'm using a Lowe HF225 to listen to BBC Radio 4 on 198kHz Long Wave, just before its due to be turned off. I could easily listen to teh live stream through my phone on the BBC iPlayer or something like that but this doesn't give any real pleasure. Sure, the programming is the same and the sound quality is probably better but there's something about the crackle of static and the hiss of the bands that is nostalgic. Like listening to Radio Tirana in the 1980's telling me that I'ma western imperialist pig or something like that.

#### Receivers

I have 2 main receivers. The [Lowe HF225](https://mwcircle.org/legacy-receiver-reviews/receiver-review-lowe-hf-225/) and a way more modern [Airpsy HF+ Discovery](https://airspy.com/airspy-hf-discovery/). Both of these have advantages and disadvantages. Teh Lowe sounds great, but the rig is pretty beaten up with some bodge repairs to the case. The SDR has amazing performance but needs a computer.

#### Antennas

Nothing special here for HF, just a long wire. For those interested in exactly what, it is a W3EDP design (so 85ft in wonky units for the driven part and 17ft for the counterpoise). I use this for HF TX'ing as well. It performs well enough for my QTH. 

Teh other antenna is for a specific purpose. It is a [PatchLoop](https://g7kse.co.uk/docs/ham-radio/patchloop/) that I've explained a bit further in the link. It is for VLF and MW really. I've got 2 loop couplers so will have a play with number of turns and see how that goe. the 6 turns I currently have is pretty good, but I can't help feel that more turns will improve the setup but not exponentially. I suspect the change in performance won't be stellar, but more likely useful. Particularly for [SAQ](https://g7kse.co.uk/docs/ham-radio/saq/)
