SAQ is an amazing piece of kit. A century old 2 phase alternator transmitter for 17.2kHz. It runs a couple of times a year generally. Once in July and once in December. Receiving the morse transmissions has been a bit of a 'standard' thing for me to do. I don't manage to receive all the transmissions but my go to equipment is the [Airpsy HF+ Discovery](airspy.com/airspy-hf-discovery/) and [PatchLoop](https://g7kse.co.uk/docs/ham-radio/patchloop/)

Here's a couple of videos of the reception
