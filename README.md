# G7KSE.CO.UK website

This site uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Hextra Theme](https://imfing.github.io/hextra/docs/). Th efiles are modified locally and sent to GitHub where are action builds the site and then that gets deployed.

Its taken a while to get it right but I'm happy with the result. The theme is pretty versatile to work with and it works for me.

Hugo uses markdown and I use a cheat sheet to help with shortcodes :-)
