As part of the 52 week ham challenge I decided to try and write a basic application that displayed some common ham radio data on a terminal. the idea was that it would become a Terminal User Interface with stuff I could use. What actually happened was that writing the code was a lot harder than I thought but it still happened, sort of. The TUI bit didn't really work and whilst I'm not going to abandon all hope, it too more than my little brain to work out what to do.

So the natural progression was to turn this into something I could use on my undesigned and totally unrealised desk module. Something to house a few of the handy boxes I have kicking about that never really manage to make it into consistent enclosures but thats another story altogether. It's very much a work in progress with some things working sort of ok and other bits not
