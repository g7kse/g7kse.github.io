My Raspberry Pi collection started with the original Pi v1. Its not much use nowadays but the collection grew to include RPi v2,3,4 and now a 5 plus a couple of RPi zero's.

The current useful crop are:

1. RPi 4 - Self hosted stuff, just small local tools that I use. Runs using Diet Pi software. Details are in the [server](https://g7kse.co.uk/docs/server/) pages
2. RPi 5 - To be turned into a desktop device that shows a few things useful to me, like the MMDVM dashboard, [fieldspotter.radio](https://fieldspotter.radio) site and a few others
3. RPi zero w - MMVDM digital voice gateway
4. RPi 3 - [Meshtastic BBS](https://g7kse.co.uk/docs/ham-radio/meshbbs/) stuff
