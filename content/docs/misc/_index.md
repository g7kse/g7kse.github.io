I'm going to dump all sorts in here. Watch me..

There are a few things I like outside radio. Like just going out on the fells for an overnight camp, I row in a 2, 2x-, 4- & 4x- at Derwentwater in Keswick with the [Lakeland Rowing Club](https://www.lakelandrowingclub.com/). The picture below is me and my main partner at Tees. I think I splashed him a bit but he ended up losing the blade. We still won the race but the picture ended up on Masters Rowing website

I've done a few Fred Whitton Rides, Marathons, half marathons and local 10k's
