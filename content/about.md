Licensed since 1992 but spent a number of years away from radio, coming back in 2004. I run a small station at my QTH which comprises of an ICOM IC-7300 with a W3EDP antenna or attic dipoles for the higher HF bands. Generally running <10 watts, sometimes I go full QRO and hit 100w but its very rare. FT817 or MTR5b for [SOTA](https://www.sota.org.uk/). You'll also hear me on the local fells as part of the [Wainwrights On The Air programme](https://wota.org.uk)

When the weather works nicely I can also be found on 13cm with an SG Lab transverter, which I can highly recommend.

I am mainly active on CW now (which I have improved massively with the help of [CW Academy](https://cwops.org/cw-academy/) - Can't rate it high enough) as well as 2m FM & occasionally SSB for SOTA. As you can tell, I am keen SOTA activator in the local western lake district. (IO84) and part time VHF contester with an interest in the Backpacker type events as well as CWT and MST evening contests.

I am active on Mastodon as [@g7kse](https://mastodon.radio/@g7kse) and a member of the 'Less Involved Data Society' who promote CW as best they can. I've got a small website that has some of my work on it.

If you hear me on the bands, and its CW, chances are I'll be portable and will be very keen to have a contact. At home it is more challenging but well worth it. My CW skills aren't amazing but its fun to have a go. Even in the CWT contests.
