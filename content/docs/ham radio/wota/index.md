Current state of play with the Wainwrights activated under [WOTA](https://www.wota.org.uk/). The grey summits are the ones I have activated.

Wainwights on the Air is a bit like SOTA but for the Wainwrights. There are 214 of them unless we're counting the outlying fells, in which case there are 330 of them.The aim of the game is to activate them all. The rules are broadly similar to SOTA but instead of 4 QSO's required to qualify the summit, it is only 1. There are fewer activators and chasers but there are more of them so an outing is generally quite productive.

I've included the routes from the [36 routes](https://www.walkingenglishman.com/walkingthewainwrights.html) that can be done to achieve all the Wainwrights that [Stuart Marshall](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1850587531/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1850587531&linkCode=as2&tag=walkinenglis-21&linkId=0d557b4c9b5c95ecf81d23d3105b02ab) published
