Ok, so this one is a bit more niche. The Anthorn time signal is transmitted on 60kHz. Every now and again receiver modules pop up mine came from [PV Electronics](https://www.pvelectronics.co.uk/) but stock comes in and out. Because it's VLF its got my attention, so you may have to juggle about a bit to find one, or make your own. Its been a while since I did this project so the best solution is to follow th eoriginal project and code on [Dances With Ferrets](http://danceswithferrets.org/geekblog/?p=44) website.

### Anthorn
OK, so what is Anthorn? or rather where is Anthorn? Well its handily titled 'Anthorn Radio Station'

The [transmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthorn_Radio_Station) is there to keep time. It does so with a pulse that can be heard on 60kHz. It has a callsign of MSF. There are similar transmitters elsewhere that do similar things. In fact there are quite a few VLF tranmitters kicking about including one of my favourites, SAQ. For a decent list you can start with the [Wikipeadia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_VLF-transmitters). Mosts of these are 'data' transmitters that won't give you much detail as they are militray or similar. Insterstingly the VLF part of teh spectrum penetrates a decent amount of water. So its handy for submarines

Otherwise feast your eyes on this amazingly produced vid.
