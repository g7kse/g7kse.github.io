Most of this site is centred around my Amateur Radio activities. The [About Me](https://g7kse.co.uk/about) has a bit more detail on what I get up to. You'll find me mostly active on [SOTA](https://sota.org.uk) on HF through to 13cm. Occasionally active from home but /P is my thing and occasionally in VHF and up contests. CW is also a favourite but not the only way I operate and always a work in progress. You'll also find me mucking about with APRS, BBS's and LoRa....QRP always!

I've created this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). This is specifically to reduce the size of the site and increase the speed. Some of it might not work perfectly but if I can do it so can you üòÅ
