For a few years I've dipped into Wefax. I like the idea of a receiver trotting along and generating images from sound. I suppose it is a bit nostalgic but there's something nicer about investing in a result rather than jusy turning it on. Setting up a reciever and decoding software to optimise the picture, only to be presented with a fuzzy output isn't entirely awesome either.

So, the happy medium is something that Patrick, ON4CDJ pointed me towards today. I'd been struggling to get a decent image out of the [GYA](https://weatherfax.com/gya-northwood/) and [DDH/DDK](https://weatherfax.com/ddh3-ddk6-hamburg/) Transmissions. So to improve things I'd switched to my [Airspy HF+ Discovery](https://airspy.com/airspy-hf-discovery/) receiver (which is amazing btw) only to be stumped with piping audio from one place to another.

The upshot of it is that I've now got a working setup with the GYA and DDK transmissions. I've also got some good images. Eventually I'll write this up so it can be repeated though. The key to it all is [JWX software](https://arachnoid.com/JWX/). Not much to set up but the images are excellent and it works acros te eusual platforms
