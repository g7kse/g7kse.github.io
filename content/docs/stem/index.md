STEM or STEAM as is also known is about the integration of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. The A in STEAM adds in Arts, but, I can just about draw the curtains so I'm in the STEM camp.

For longer than I can remember I have been involved with schools and giving back. Although the focus has changed slighty, the core stuff remains pretty similar. The sort of history is a bit like...

### School STEM project

A school decides that it wants to do a project. It used to just ask the local businesses to volunteer a graduate. they would then go to the school and be chaperoned around if they were lucky to help the students do stuff. It's a reasonable way to go about it but relies on consistent teaching and time given to the students. I did once meet one of my students at work and that was kind of nice.

### Regional STEM stuff

This works a lot better. My local one collects and marries up requests from schools with registered STEM peeps. This way I've got involved with..

* Science week
* [Lego League](https://www.firstlegoleague.org/)
* [CANSAT](https://www.esa.int/Education/CanSat/What_is_a_CanSat)

### Mentoring

I now mentor, or rather have been for about 5ish years. I do this internally with graduates and also with [Arkwright Scholars](https://www.arkwright.org.uk/). This is for 'A' Level students who are interviewed before being given the scholarships. These are very clever young people, most are very driven people and far brighter than me. A pleasure to work with.
