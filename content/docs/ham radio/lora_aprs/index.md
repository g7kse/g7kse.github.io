In 2021 I did a STEM project with a school called CANSAT. The project used LoRa modules to transmit data from a model rocket payload and a ground station. I started to get interested in these modules and to cut a long story short have a few of the Lillygo [TBEAM](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/32967228739.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2bra) versions.

The version I have runs on 433MHz and use the code in the links above. I ended up using this code because of a change in component on my boards that meant some of the other code that is also used wouldn't work and ended up in a boot loop.

As a little toy it's quite fun to see how far 100mW can go but realistically without adding additional components they aren't going to replace my APRS hand held

### Fast forward to now-ish

Since starting to look at this there has been a bit of a mini explosion in this area. The T Beam modules have been overtaken a litlle bit by the [Heltec Tacker](https://heltec.org/project/wireless-tracker/) modules that are a little bit more compact and are slightly better performing. thats not to say that the T Beam is useless, far from it , but the Heltec ones are a bit more polished.

Note: mine is on order so I can't really comment on how good it is but I will as soon as it arrives.

### UK Frequency

There was a bit of 'bedding in' needed with the frequency for APRS in the UK. It has settled on 439.9125 MHz as its out of the way of everything else and less like to cause QRM. The good news is that there has been a relaxing in the tyoe of NoV required for things like digipeaters. So a few solar powered ones are kicking about that make use of the low power requirements.

### Software

1. [Richon Guzman](https://github.com/richonguzman/LoRa_APRS_Tracker) - Just use this...just works. Use the web flasher for the simplest method.

Nothing else required

### Wrapping it all up into something useable

I've long been a user of [Onshape](www.onshape.com) for mechanical design. I've got used to it as a tool and find it handy for knocking up designs. So for my [LoRa Tracker case](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c8df066450d36ad4f810e6c6/w/aa97bc8b595751e53645d2bf/e/8692383db96211fed1d43931?renderMode=0&uiState=67b86afed4505e2c18cbbfad) there should be no surprise that I've used the usual. One good thing about this software is that it is browser based and I can easily share designs without needing to update things in here. Changes are live!

![Tracker Case](LoRa_case.png#centre)

This is the preliminary design and no doubt it'll get changed in due course but its pretty simple. A lower part holds the battery and switch. The centre part holds the Heltec Tracker and the upper is there for the screen and buttons. I've done it this way so that if there is a need for bigger batteries it can be accomodated, same for boards. My basic parts are...

The image below is to help explain something. Lots of parts I see used don't make good use of threads. Mostly there are holes that are effectively pilot holes that end up getting threaded because a screw needs to cut its own thread. I'm not a fan. For a few quid threaded inserts can help massively. These are brass parts that can either be pressed into parts or in this case can be placed and then pressed in place with some heat. I use a tip of a soldering iron to do this. It doesn't need much heat and the heat helps to bond them in situ. A much better solution to teh problem for me

I'll be trialling this design over the next month or so, then if it needs any adjustments I'll do that before puttinig it onto [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@g7kse_197848)
