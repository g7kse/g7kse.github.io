This ia a bit of a notebook more than anything else. i have loads of things just kicking about on bits of paper and stuff like that. Most of them are semi forgotten, but most should be written down. Not least of which because I'll be swimming in the [River of forgetfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethe) and will no doubt forget why I put that there as well :-)

## Sections

It should be pretty obvious but. There is stuff on..

1. [Ham Radio](https://g7kse.co.uk/docs/ham-radio/) - my main hobby
2. [Raspberry Pi](https://g7kse.co.uk/docs/raspberrypi/) & various microcontroller type things
3. [Coding](https://g7kse.co.uk/docs/coding/) - Snippets and bits I use
4. [Misc](https://g7kse.co.uk/docs/misc/) -  Mostly reference material for things like decarbonisation and general non techie things
