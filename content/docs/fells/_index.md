being outside is pretty important to me. Some of the time I record where I've been and whilst I do use propriety tools to record where I've been it quite nice to build a map of the routes you've taken, with your own notes that isn't part of a platform that might not serve what is really useful to remember. The is built up from recorded tracks or routes I've planned and may have not recorded , or even routes I've not managed to achieve just yet.

I haven't quite finished the map but will do shortly...I promise :-)
