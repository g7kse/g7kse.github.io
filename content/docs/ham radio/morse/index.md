### A few resources for the budding CW Operator.

Below are a few bits and pieces that might be useful.

#### Getting Started

I can rate it highly enough but [CWOps CW Academy](https://cwops.org/cw-academy/) it THE place to learn. The set up is pretty simple. Complete an online assessment to work out where you are in your learning journey. Then sign up for a class. 

The classes are pretty intense but that works well. 16 sessions over 8 weeks, the superstars amongst you will work out that this is twice a week as a 'class'. Well they're not really classes, more of a time to do some CW together. The learning really happens outside those meet up's. An advisor will guide the sessions but the homework is all yours to do and the meet up is a good time to do some group exercises like head copy (you'd be surprised how much you can remember and its one of my favourites).

Tools like [RufzXP](https://www.rufzxp.net/), [Morse Machine](http://www.g4ilo.com/morse-machine.html) and pile up simulators like [Morse Runner](https://github.com/w7sst/MorseRunner) are massive helps but really getting on air is the key...but there are some golden rules.

1. Start at a speed you want to send at, not at a slow speed expecting to build up. The Koch method works well but character speed should be 20-25 WPM. Doing things this way will reduce the likelihood of developing mental lookup tables

2. Don't write everything down. Sure write key info like Name, QTH, RST and details like that. Head copy is the target. After all I don't write down stuff when I have a conversation with someone in the street. That'd be weird, and the kind of this that Faceplant (tm) does (other odd companies that read your email are available)

3. Learn together, if you have to commit to learning with someone else you're more likely to actually complete your goal. That goes with just about everything.

4. Hands up whop hasn't made a mistake....thought so. You're not sending vital inofmration that has to be right every time. If you make a mistake, send a few dit's, resend that word and move on.

5. Don't send faster than you can receive. I really struggle with receiving, so have to work really hard to headcopy at speed that other find straightforward. But...don't let that hold you back, teh harder you try the better you'll be.

#### Receiving Practice

##### Squeeze Keying

Squeeze keying exercises help to reduce teh amount of movement you make. They can be a bit of a handful (pardon the pun) but thats the idea. Remember 'smooth is accurate.
