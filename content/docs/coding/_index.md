I'm no coder by most measures. But I do collect a few bits and pieces that might be useful every now and again. But...there is something that I'm looking to do. HamTool is command line menu of stuff that I frequently do. Its nothing to write home about but its there to help me learn a little bit more about Python.

Very little of this is original...most of it is stuff that I've found and used as is or adapted slightly for my own use.

I prefer command line things to GUI's but not for everything. That would be weird. Mostly what I mess about with are really basic things that the more experienced will find trivial. Some of the stuff include:

> [!NOTE]
> Setting the time on my IC7300 because the battery is useless. this is a little script that I've adapted from someone else's work to set the time.

> [!NOTE]
> Using the [MSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_from_NPL_(MSF)) Anthorn time signal to create a simple clock using an Arduino. 

> [!NOTE]
> A STEM project called [CANSAT](https://www.esa.int/Education/CanSat/What_is_a_CanSat) that used Raspberry Pi Pico boards and LoRa to send telemetry.
