I'm no coder by most measures. But I do collect a few bits and pieces that might be useful every now and again. But...there is something that I'm looking to do. HamTool is command line menu of stuff that I frequently do. Its nothing to write home about but its there to help me learn a little bit more about Python.

Very little of this is original...most of it is stuff that I've found and used as is or adapted slightly for my own use.

I prefer command line things to GUI's but not for everything. That would be weird. Mostly what I mess about with are really basic things that the more experienced will find trivial. Some of the stuff include:

### A few things that I wanted to do

HamTools is a simple collection of scripts, written in Python that display stuff on the console. It isn't polished at all and the look and feel needs a lot of work but thats for later on

- [x] Setting the time on my IC7300 because the battery is useless. [I adapted an existing script for me](https://github.com/g7kse/HamTool/blob/main/set_time.py)
- [x] Calculate the distance and bearing of 2 Maidenhead locators. A bit of help on this one but the [script works](https://github.com/g7kse/HamTool/blob/main/maidenhead.py)
- [x] Make a little [menu](https://github.com/g7kse/HamTool/blob/main/main.py) system
- [ ] Adapter POTA and SOTA code to look the same
- [ ] Make a lookup for [CWOps callsigns](https://github.com/g7kse/HamTool/blob/main/cwops.py)

There are all sorts of things that could be put in there as the image suggests. Quite a few are outside my capability. So I'll do what I can, when I can.
